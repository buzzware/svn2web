Subversion hook script to automatically copy committed files to a server-in-the-sky.
Written in php.

REQUIREMENTS:

svn2web uses the following command-line programs:
  php svnlook cp  rm  mkdir  cd
If using ftp or sftp to upload files:
  expect ftp sftp

HOW TO USE:

1) Uncompress svn2web somewhere on your box and give all the files execution
permission.

2) You need to exec svn2web script (previusly uncompressed) from your pre-commit hook. 
The hooks directory is "root_of_repository/hooks", name must be "pre-commit" 
and it must be executable.  Also, the hook MUST set an appropriate PATH;

Normally when you create your repo your pre-commit hook have the name
pre-commit.tmpl you must rename it and add execution permissions.

  cd root_of_repository/hooks
  mv pre-commit.tmpl pre-commit
  chmod +x pre-commit

Now edit the pre-commit file and add the lines to call svn2web (check the 
last lines of this document).

3) Then, add a "svn2web" property to the branch or directory that should
get copied (e.g. on the trunk):
  cd trunk
  svn propset svn2web "sftp:username:password@machine:/path" .
  svn commit -N -m "Upload commits to server." .

Use:
  file:/path    Copies to /path/ on the same machine as the svn repository.
  ftp:username:password@machine:/path   Uses ftp to copy to another machine.
  sftp:username:password@machine:/path  Uses sftp

If a branch/directory should get copied multiple places, use svn
propedit and list each on a separate line.

Also, note that if a subdirectory has the svn2web property set, then
that setting OVERRIDES the parent's setting.

The put_ftp/put_sftp/remove_ftp/remove_sftp files must be executable,
and must be in the same directory as the svn2web utility.

EXAMPLE pre-commit HOOK:
-------------------------
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
svn2web $1 $2 >> /tmp/svn2web.log || exit 1
exit 0
